## ML trading bot

ML trading bot (stored as **machine_learning_traing_bot.ipynb**) is a multi-function Jupyter Lab notebook to is a simulation of a trading bot for a stock firm. Improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firmâ€™s competitive advantage in the market. Enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

**Original Output: (DateOffSet = 3 months, SMA short = 4, long =100)**
![plot of actual returns vs strategy returns](./output.png)

**Second Output: (DateOffSet = 6 months, SMA short = 4, long =100)**
![plot of actual returns vs strategy returns](./output_6months.png)

When extending the training window we experience a larger difference in results, first in a loss then a positive. Overall the longer training window gave us a much more successful result.

**Third Output: (DateOffSet = 6 months, SMA short = 20, long =150)**
![plot of actual returns vs strategy returns](./output_SMA_adjust.png)

When extending the training window and extending the SMA windows we experience a closer difference in results. However overall we experience more loss by extending the SMA window.

When running the original model using 'SVC'  classifier model we recieved the following results:

When running the alternative model using 'LogisticRegression' classifier model we recieved the following results:

## Technologies

**machine_learning_traing_bot.ipynb** is a Jupyter labnotebook with python abilities. It leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* pandas 
* numpy
* hvplot
* matplotlib
* svm (from sklearn)
* DateOffset (from pandas.tseries.offsets)
* StandardScaler (from sklearn.preprocessing)
* classification_report (from sklearn.metrics)


Data in this notebook is pulled from CSV file (emerging_mnarkets_ohlcv.csv) in the Resources folder. It is provided in the repository

## Installation Guide

This file is accessible via Jupyter Lab in your browser. Be sure to Restart Kernel when launching
